# Final Word
 
## Ready! 
Now, you should start looking at our real projects.

### OBS
Wait, small things/steps you should check.

#### Step(1)
You shall read everything about **Polymer** by yourself and discover its features.
Please remember from now you need to use real coding as you learn to make sure the knowledge you learned you use? 
##### The Reference: [Link](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up)

#### Step(2)
Start by cloning the web templates, two of them are available: 
1.  The template which we all are involved and mostly done by someone more skilled so Please ask about. 
link https://github.com/apegroup/apegroup-template-web

2.  Another template but not used anymore since we have a better template. This template is taken from one big project “Fortnum Project” we cleaned it up and removed all unnecessary files and directories.

## Note(1):
We believe that the whole template is clear for you and almost you are familiar with the whole contents:) don't you? 

#### Step(3)
Please ask your colleagues for the simplest projects we have done before. 
Don’t make the same mistake I did with big project where I felt that I am lost
Always back to your colleagues they know where from you can start.
