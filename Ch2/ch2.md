# Chapter 2
Quick start with examples and references in addition some real coding examples to get familiar with your future tools 

## JavaScript
We assume that you already have some knowledge about at least one programming languages most likely **Java** as it is in most common language used in Sweden or European countries 
So, your mission now is to see some new stuff in __JavaScript__ and get familiar with it.
