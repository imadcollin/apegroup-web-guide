At Apegroup, we have many departments and we use various technologies nowdays. 
One of our departments is a web department where we build web solutions and deliver nice work to our clients. 

### Technologies
 -  We use Javascript as a main programming language so, you must focus on this language and forget about other for now.
 
 - The second key is HTML and CSS where both are the core of any web based solutions/application  

 - The third key is NodeJs, where this is an open source JavaScript runtime environment.  
   Be patient we will go through everything you need about NodeJs 
 
 - The forth key is Polymer “an open source web components library”.
