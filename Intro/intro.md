At Apegroup, we have many departments and we use various technologies nowadays 
One of our departments is a web department where we build web solutions and deliver nice work to our clients. 

### Technologies
 -  We use Java script as a main programming language so, you must focus on this language     and forget about other for now.
 
 - The second key is HTTML and CSS where both are the core of any web based                 solutions/application  

 - The third key is NodeJs, where this is an open source JavaScript runtime environment.  
   Be patient we will go through everything you need about NodeJs 
 
 - The forth key is Polymer “also an open source java script library” call it framework if you like
